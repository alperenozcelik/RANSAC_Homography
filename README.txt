I have written the tasks of each function in my code in detail in my report section. 
There are 5 libraries in the import section to run the code:
-numpy
-matplotlib
-cv2
-scipy
-glob
libraries must be installed on your computer.
After that you need to download the zip file from 

https://www.iiia.csic.es/~aramisa/datasets/iiiapanos.html 

by clicking the link titled "iiia04actes".
There are 14 more zip files in the downloaded zip file. 

The "iiia04actes-cyl-pano07.zip" file that I use in my code. 

When you enter it, it is enough to run the "iiia04actes-cyl-pano07" file that 
appears in the same folder as the .py file I sent, to run my code. 

The names of the other 2 datasets I tried are at the bottom of my py file. You can try them the same way.
